# Protobuf CI
A collection of actions and reusable workflows for CI testing in Protobuf
repositories.

Actions and workflows here are expected to be reusable and changes here should apply
to multiple test files/languages. If you want to make a change to a single test or
language please make the change directly in the main protobuf repository.

Any change in this repository that you wish to see reflected in other Protobuf
repositories requires a release.
