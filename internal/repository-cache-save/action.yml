name: Restore Repository Cache
description: Restore the Bazel repository cache from our github action cache

# Note: this action will only work if repository-cache-restore has already
# been called.  All bazel actions should specify the repository_cache parameter
# using REPOSITORY_CACHE_PATH.
#
# We intentionally upload to REPOSITORY_CACHE_BASE to prevent a flood of new
# caches on any change.  Only 1 job per os in each test run will be allowed to
# update the cache because they're all trying to write to the same location.
